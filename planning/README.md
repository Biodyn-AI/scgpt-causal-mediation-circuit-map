# Planning

Source plan: `market_research/ambitious_paper_questions/plan_causal_mediation_circuit_map.md`.

Execution scope for this subproject:
- Re-run mediation tracing for curated TF-target pairs on kidney/lung/immune.
- Estimate head- and MLP-level mediator effects.
- Quantify mediator concentration and cross-tissue overlap.


## Agent Completion Tracking
- Do this for your project: `tracking/prompt.md`.
- When you finish meaningful work, update `tracking/prompt.md` with the project status (progress, decisions, blockers, and next step).
- Skip the update only if nothing meaningful changed.
