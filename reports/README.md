## Scientific Narrative Gate
- Mandatory: follow `reports/WRITING_GUIDELINES.md` and `reports/SCIENTIFIC_NARRATIVE_GATE.md` for every manuscript/PDF.
- A report is not review-ready if any major result section is metric-only without interpretation and biological meaning.


## Agent Completion Tracking
- Do this for your project: `tracking/prompt.md`.
- When you finish meaningful work, update `tracking/prompt.md` with the project status (progress, decisions, blockers, and next step).
- Skip the update only if nothing meaningful changed.
